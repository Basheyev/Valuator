                <p> The service performs private company valuation using four main methods:
                    EBITDA Multiple, Comparable Multiple, Discounted Cash Flow (DCF),
                    and the VC Method.

            </p>
                </p>
                <p> To perform the calculations, service needs following private company
                    data: revenue, EBITDA, free cash flow forecasts dataset for 2-5 years,
                    equity invested and its interest rate, debt borrowed and its interest
                    rate, cash and equivalents, venture exit year and venture interest rate,
                    market share and public comparable company stock ticker.
                </p>
                <p> World Bank API provides country GDP average growth, average inflation,
                    corporate tax rate, base rate, and market return rate. Alpha Vantage API
                    provides public comparable company stock data,

                <br>
                <p>We need to estimate the exit value of the company based on its current financial
                   situation, forecasts and country macroeconomic indicators: </p>

                        <td>EBITDA multiple</td>
                        <td>The EBITDA multiple method is the fastest way to estimate a
                            company's value by multiplying EBITDA by a multiple (2x-15x),
                            which is calculated as follows. First, we need to calculate the
                            AAGR (Average Annual Growth Rate) between the first and
                            last positive EBITDA values, taking into account the number
                            of periods (years).
                            <br><br>
                            Next, we calculate the Net Growth Rate (NGR),
                            which is the difference between AAGR (as a decimal, e.g., 0.0-1.0)
                            and the Average Inflation Rate (as a decimal, e.g., 0.0-1.0).
                            The multiplier is calculated using a base value of 1.5x,
                            NGR, and the company's Market Share (as a decimal, e.g., 0.0-1.0).
                            <br><br>
                            The Enterprise Value is then calculated by multiplying the first
                            positive EBITDA by the multiple. Next, calculate the Net Financial
                            Position (NFP), which is the difference between the company’s debt
                            and cash & equivalents. Finally, determine the company's valuation
                            by subtracting NFP from the Enterprise Value.
